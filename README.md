# Chat based on OpenAI api

This is my tiny pet project.
The project is deployed at <https://goodbadgood.dev/>

## Getting Started

* Rename **.env.example** file to **.env.local**
* Update NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY in **.env.local** with [your OpenAI api key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-api-key)

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

OpenAI API is unavailable in Russia without VPN, so make sure you have one installed to be able to run valid develomplent server
